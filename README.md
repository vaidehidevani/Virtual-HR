<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> :pencil: About The Project</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
 The project aims to develop a computer vision system that optimizes the recruitment process by predicting emotions from facial expressions in real time. Through machine learning, the system will be trained to analyze candidates' facial expressions during interviews, allowing it to assess their confidence levels. By comparing the candidates' responses with the expected responses stored in the system, the tool aims to efficiently identify qualified candidates. This virtual HR system has the potential to save valuable time and resources, enabling organizations to quickly identify suitable candidates for the next round of interviews.

<h2 id="Problem-statement"> :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Problem Statement</h2>

<p align="justify"> 

* The traditional recruitment process often requires significant time and effort to evaluate candidates and identify the most suitable individuals for the position. This process can be subjective and prone to human bias.

* Evaluating candidates' emotions and confidence levels during interviews can be challenging. To address these issues, a system that uses computer vision techniques to optimize the recruitment process is needed.

* By providing a tool that efficiently identifies qualified candidates, the system aims to significantly reduce the time and resources required for the interview and assessment process, ultimately improving the effectiveness of recruitment efforts.
